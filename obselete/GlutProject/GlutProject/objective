Functions to be realized 

1. viewing

    1.1 resize the window (glutReshapeFunc, glViewport, glOrtho, glLoadIdentity)
    1.2 zoom in and out, drag image
    1.3 all that by keeping the level of detail unchanged (runtime fractal generating)

2. pattern drawing
    
    2.1 define the growth path of fractals
    2.2 impose limits on recurrance times, but modifiable depending on the viewing condition
    2.3  

3. fractal generating

4. coloring
